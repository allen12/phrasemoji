# phrasemoji

## Description
_phrasemoji_ is a web application game that has each participant in the group (limited to even-numbered groups) log in to a personalized, private unique game session. The first player receives a proverb-like English sentence, and he or she and each subsequent player translates the preceding message into a series of emoticons or back into plain English.

After the final person translates the preceding emoticon message back to plaintext, each participant receives the original and final messages as well as each step along the path of conversions. Hilarious laughter ensues and the game is finished, before each player clicks to play again.
